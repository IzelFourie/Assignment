Coursera - getting and cleaning data

## How my script works
I only submitted one script and it consists of the following components
1. **Download** data.
2. **Read** train data, test data and other relevant data.
3. **Edit** data.
4. **Analyze** data.

A description of how the data is edited and anlysed is described in my CodeBook document.
